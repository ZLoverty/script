========

Put PIV data from separated text files into a .mat file, in order to keep the number of files small and meantime save some storage space.

.. rubric:: Syntax

.. code-block:: console

   python wrap_piv.py piv_folder

* piv_folder: piv data folder containing .csv files

.. note::

   If the given folder contains .txt files generated by ImageJ PIV, we need to run `rename_ij_piv.py` first to convert the file name and format.

.. warning::

   The original .csv files will be deleted once the .mat file is saved.
